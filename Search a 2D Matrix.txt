Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.


class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
        for test_list in matrix:
            if (target in test_list):
                print(target)
                return True
                break
        return False
